  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of a fixed-point recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for first-order Markov channel estimation and derives expressions for the mean weight misadjustment. The expressions derived are general in that they take into account the correlation in the input. It is shown that correlation amplifies the effect of roundoff error due to the desired signal estimate computation and the additive system noise. The misadjustment due to time-varying system weights and the weight update roundoff error behave similarly and are minimally affected by the input correlation. They contribute to the total misadjustment in such a way that is directly proportional to the algorithm's time constant which is a function of the algorithm forgetting factor. The contributions of system noise and roundoff error due to the desired estimate, on the other hand, are inversely proportional to the algorithm time constant. Hence, they indicate a tradeoff in the choice of the forgetting factor to balance the effects of these noise sources. We present simulation results which demonstrate very good agreement with the theory.

  abstract = {In the fifth edition of this textbook, author Paulo S.R. Diniz presents updated text on the basic concepts of adaptive signal processing and adaptive filtering. He first introduces the main classes of adaptive filtering algorithms in a unified framework, using clear notations that facilitate actual implementation. Algorithms are described in tables, which are detailed enough to allow the reader to verify the covered concepts. Examples address up-to-date problems drawn from actual applications. Several chapters are expanded and a new chapter 'Kalman Filtering is included. The book provides a concise background on adaptive filtering, including the family of LMS, affine projection, RLS, set-membership algorithms and Kalman filters, as well as nonlinear, sub-band, blind, IIR adaptive filtering, and more. Problems are included at the end of chapters. A MATLAB package is provided so the reader can solve new problems and test algorithms. The book also offers easy access to working algorithms for practicing engineers.},
